# Raspberry Pi Arcade Controller

The intention of this project is to develop an arcade controller with a Raspberry Pi inside where you can simply connect the HDMI cable and power to have a RetroPie console and enjoy all the classic games.

The 3D model was designed using the free software [DesignSpark Mechanical](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/mechanical-software).

* *arcade_controller.rsdoc* is the main design file.

In order to print the model, I plit it in two pieces, top and bottom. You can simply download the *.STL* files in order to print it with any 3D Printer.

Please feel free to improve the design and share the results!
